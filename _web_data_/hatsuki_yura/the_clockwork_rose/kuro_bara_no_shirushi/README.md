(modified)  

When I was very young, I noticed that what we call 'love' has been stolen from me.
In your impatient gaze, a breast of rose in full bloom..
My feelings are growing violently into a deep madness.

Now, even if it's a fantasy, my eyes are closing to darkness.
I am controlled fortely by those kind words,
Where this engraved wound doesn't vanish, and turns into a curse.
Drowned in a fever and hot sighs.. Your lips..
I become intoxicated of this discovered dream !

"Shining silver hair and a generous denuded body…
I am fascinated !"

I want you, now !

"It's useless to fight against the crafty finger of the beautiful witch."

This is the contract of the seal of the black rose!

I'm not corrupted, I'm not flirting with anyone else.
Although, I'm keeping my promise, I derive in the liberty of the night.
A little of my solitude is filled by you.
But, this ugly invisible animal passion, commits a sin and despair...
Show me everything!

"Even if it's just for a short time : the smile of the ephemeral girl..
I want to please you""

Entwined fingers...

Drowned voice and gaze… Broken reason, with the rest...

I'm not gonna believe this farce!

Dressed of thorns, this small bud
Will wait to bloom someday,
To be proud of your blood as food...

"Shining silver hair and a generous denuded body…
I am fascinated!"

I want you, now!

"Even if it's just for a short time : the smile of the ephemeral girl..
I want to please you"

Entwined fingers...

"Drowned voice and gaze... Broken reason, with the rest..."

Playfully manipulating fate!
