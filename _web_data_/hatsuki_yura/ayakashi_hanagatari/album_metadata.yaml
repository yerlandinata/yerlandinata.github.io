      妖 = あやかし = アヤカシ = Ayakashi = in our case "ayakashi" refers to the strange phenomenon, when something suspicious and supernatural happens.
      After, listening the CD, I chose the word "Mystical", in reference of different Youkai creatures.
      華 = はな = ハナ = Hana = the word "hana" means "flower." All youkai in the CD are represented by different flowers.
      語り = がたり = ガタリ = gatari = gatari is a form that you never find in the dictionary.
      It is katari (narrative or story-telling) in the compounding state.
      This word refers when someone says a speech or tell a story. It's even possible than "gatari" is actually cut from the word "monogatari",
      that means story or tale. The full expression "Hana Gatari" can refers to "the tales of different flowers".
      So, once again there is no doubt that Yura is playing with this expression, to refer to the "Fairy Tales".
      I translated the word by Recital for the translation, because the track six of the CD has the same form, in the title of the song.
      I think Yura has made a wink to the track six.
      Special thanks to SuperCoolGuy and Zio, for the English help.
      Special thanks to Sekigawa, for the romaji correction.

      Globally a CD very excellent, for me, but that suffers also of many problems. And sadly, I have the feeling that those problems come crush, all the good sides of the CD.
      Let's begin with the composition. Once again, I'm not fan of oriental Japanese. Giving a judgement on that, is really difficult for me. In reason of that, sadly, I don't have any "firm favorite," in this CD. The compositions that enjoy the most are from Amedio and Tsukagoshi. Globally, I don't dislike any composition, but, honestly, I was waiting something better. To be frank, I find all compositions better in the CDs 宵闇恋想奇譚 (Yoiyami Rensou Kitan) or 幻恋楼閣談集 (Maboroshi Koi Roukaku Dan Shuu). I have the feeling some compositors has worked very hard to do them, but not enough, to have an excellent quality.
      Let give me my impression about the lyrics. Any stories has disappointed me in the CD. The lyrics are really well written, but sadly (for me) I don't make an honor in the song of the snake and prostitute, because the words used refer to too many things in Japanese and lose a lot of their values and sense. It doesn't mean my translations are bad, but there are just written to let you understand what happen in the song. The three other translations are safe, however.
      The CD is only a sentimental one. All songs are full of feelings. Yura has put a lot of feeling in those youkai. It's difficult to not cry for some songs. But that's the problem of the CD itself.
      In fact, I don't understand why Yura has said the CD is about dangerous youkai, like the one from "The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons (hyakkiyakou)." Hyakkiyakou is not something funny, to Japan: you can be killed and your soul can be stolen by youkai. At the end, the Hyakkiyakou was just referring to the song of Drop. So, why Yura just don't has said: "the CD is about sentimental youkai." My opinion about lyrics will be different. So, yes the CD lack of diversity. And it's really its big default.
      Every time each song turns about the love of a youkai for someone/something and all the consequent about that. There are always love songs in all CD from Yura, but put a CD only about that, was not the best thing to do. In the CD Clockwork, all songs were turning about love, but with a story inside it, that was giving something really unique, every time. In this CD is more "depression love of youkai" each time. Anyways, if you were waiting a CD, with dangerous Youkai, and pure madness from them, that don't exist in this CD. All madness comes from their love.
      I don't know how many people have enjoy the CD or are waiting the translation to have a proper judgement, but I don't guarantee that you will like more the CD, even with my translations. I think you can't even by disappointed (it depends completely what you were waiting).
      Yura's voice in the CD… Honestly, we are really far from the goddess work she has made in FairiA. Once again, I enjoy all songs sung by Yura. Actually, I think Yura's voice is in agreement in most songs that really make me love some of them. That's the case specially, for the song of Amedio and Tsukagoshi. It's really the good point of Yura's voice in the CD. But now, if I'm looking far away and compare to hers previous songs she has done, I don't find Yura's voice so much glorious, everywhere. Even if I love some songs, nothing has really excited my heart. I will not hide it, I have already see Yura do better songs.
      That was my general opinion, and like you see, it's not great so much. But once again, I'm not fan of oriental Japanese music that probably doesn't give me a good opinion about songs. I don't dislike the CD at all. I actually enjoy it. There are good things, but also bad things in the CD. But, because it's not the first oriental Japanese CD made by Yura, overall, even if I find the CD excellent, I was really waiting something better.
