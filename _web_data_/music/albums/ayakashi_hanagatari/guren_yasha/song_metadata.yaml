  誓いは夕暮れ格子 私を引き寄せ
  お前だけがすべてだと 肌をめぐりくちづけた
  幻されど尊くひとときの夢見 
  少女は心奪われ  ただひたすら堕ちていく
  指きりしまた明日と微笑みを浮かべながら
  交わした心と心
  何故 何処 隠す月 会いたい 今すぐ

  紅蓮の炎が照らす夜
  貴方の為に鐘打ち鳴らす
  罪無き魂を道連れ 地獄への扉を開いた
  いざや隠れ鬼

  はしゃぎ廻る髑髏達 提灯行列 物の怪共
  うつつまぼろしどれも
  真実であってなきようなものぞ
  鴉が七つ鳴く頃 魂と燃ゆるは曼殊沙華
  甘美 柘榴 錆紅 宴じゃ 練り歩く百鬼夜行

  逃げ惑う群れの中に 貴方の姿が
  腕の中に守るのは私じゃない牡丹華

  逃げ惑う群れの中に 貴方の姿が
  腕の中に守るのは私じゃない牡丹華

  指きりし また明日と
  微笑みを浮かべながら 結んだ命と命
  憎しみ 怨めしい 殺めたい 今すぐ

  紅蓮の炎が照らす夜 貴方の為に
  嗚呼、夜叉になる
  罪無き魂を道連れ 地獄への扉を開いた
  いざや隠れ鬼

  血をすすり 肉を屠るより
  貴方の吐息だけ感じたい
  魂を捕えて灯そう
  闇に響く童歌

  紅蓮の炎が照らす夜 私の為に影 狂い舞え
  空浮かぶ朧月 心 涙を照らし欠ける
  散らした恋の花弁

      The crystal twilight, takes me to my pledge,
      I kissed your skin, everywhere, entirely and only for you.
      Even if it's an illusion—this is a very precious moment of a dream.
      The heart of the girl has been stolen, and doing nothing else than falling down...

      Still pointing my finger at tomorrow, and while my smile floats—
      Intertwined heart and heart...
      How long the moon will be hidden? I want to see you, right now.

      The flames of red lotus illuminate the night,
      I ring the bell, only for you.
      Unintentionally, my innocent soul, opened the door leading to hell,
      And come the demons of the underworld.

      Frenetic skulls, a line of paper lanterns, together with vengeful spirits,
      Is it reality or an illusion?
      Such monsters can't be true...
      As soon as, the seven ravens sing, the soul and the burning red spider lily,
      Deliver a sweet pomegranate, for a crimson party—the night parade of one hundred demons.

      Among the escaping crowd, you were there.
      I'm not a peony flower that needs to be protected in your arms.

      Still pointing my finger at tomorrow,
      And while my smile floats—connected life and life.
      Hatred, contempt... I want to kill, right now.

      The flames of red lotus illuminate the night.
      Ah, I become a Yasha, for you!
      Unintentionally, my innocent soul, opened the door leading to hell,
      And come the demons of the underworld.

      More than a massacre of your flesh, I drink your blood,
      Because I want to feel only your breath.
      In the darkness resounds a nursery rhyme,
      Since I set your captive soul on fire.

      The song is inspired by Yaoya Oshichi and the Night Parade of One Hundred Demons (hyakkiyakou).
      It's a mysterious song, where the girl has promised to see, once again, her lover. 
      To fulfil her promise, she put the fire to the town, ring the fire bell, and wait for the person that she I loved, to escape (thanks to Yura's comment).
      But when she put the fire to the town, something supernatural has happened. Without being aware, the girl seems to have open the door of hell, leading the youkai of underworld to her town. Then, the town is attacked by the dangerous youkai and the fire.
      People from the town will run away, against that chaos. And the girl will finally able to see her lover, once again, who was escaping of the town.
      In order to protect him, from people who private him, and the dangerous youkai; the soul of the girl will be stolen during The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons (hyakkiyakou). The girl will turn herself as a powerful youkai which is a Yasha.
      Then, it will begin a massacre in the town. The girl will begin to kill everyone. But by error, she will also kill her lover. Youkai are creature that can eat humans. So, she eat the fresh and the blood of her beloved one. Until his soul. The end of the song is about her tears, regret and her powerlessness, against the action she has committed.

      こちらは「八百屋お七」をモチーフに書いてみました。好きな人に会いたいがために
      町に火をつけて半鐘を自分で鳴らして好きな人が逃げてくるのを待ってる感じです。
      純粋だけど狂った思考って良いですな。

          In this song, I tried to write the lyrics, in being inspired by "Yaoya Oshichi."
          I have written the feelings as: "I want to meet the person that I'm loving". 
          I put the fire to the town, I ring the fire bell by myself, and wait for the person I love, to escape.
          Pure, but also crazy thoughts are pleasant.

          Yaoya Oshichi is the daughter of a grower who lives in Edo, in the district of Hongou.
          She tries to cause a fire to find a boy she loves. Despite her young age but because she is over 15 years old, she suffers the punishment reserved for incendiaries.

      To change a little, finally Drop came back with an ancient style of composition, which is oriental.
      I really don't dislike this composition, but less be clear, I find this composition really inferior to all his compositions in 宵闇恋想奇譚 (Yoiyami Rensou Kitan).
      Globally I was waiting really something better. I was thinking Drop will have time to work his new composition, in reason of the fact, he was not here in FairiA.
      But it doesn't seem to be really the case. Practically, sure a lot of people are disappointed by this one.
      Yura's voice is correct, but have nothing really special. The passage the more impressive is the fast one between 1.25-1.38. Too bad that there are not more passage of this style.
      Yura has been already more impressive in Drop's composition, something that I will not hide it.
      Lyrics are for me, all the thing that catch up the song. I think, I will never like this song, if I will understand anything from Japanese.
      But lyrics are really excellent. I love all the story and the movie you can do with it.
      All the different actions from the girl in the song, the part where the two people see each other once again, were very touching for me.
      The end of the song was also very interesting, when the girl becomes of Yasha. I really love also how Yura has mixed all the different type of "hyakkiyakou", in the song.
      I was very impressed. This song was clearly the one where I was the more impressed during the translation. There are my favorite lyrics from the CD.
      At the end, I find the music really excellent and I really enjoy it. Even if Yura's voice and Drop's composition are not the best, the whole story confer by YuraXDrop was enough interesting for me, to enjoy it until the end.
      Yura is doing "gothic tales," so I think always it's better to have a better story to the detriment to compositionXvoice.
